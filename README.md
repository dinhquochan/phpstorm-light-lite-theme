This colorscheme is custom by me. This is [a original colorscheme](https://github.com/brendt/phpstorm-light-lite-theme).

# A minimalistic light colour scheme for PhpStorm

If you need convincing of a light colour scheme, I'd like to direct you to [a post](*https://stitcher.io/blog/a-programmers-cognitive-load) on the topic. 

Colours are based on Google's logo:

| Colours | | | |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| `#4285F4` | `#EA4334` | `#FCBC05` | `#34A853` |

## Installation

In PhpStorm, go to `Settings > Editor > Color Scheme` press the little cog next to the scheme selector, and choose `Import Scheme`.

## Contributing

This theme is still a work in progress. Feel free to send PRs and open issues.
